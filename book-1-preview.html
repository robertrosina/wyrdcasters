    <h2>Wyrdcasters: Chaos in a Dying Realm</h2>
    <p>by Robert Rosina</p>
    <p><em></em></p>
    <img src="your-novel-cover.jpg" alt="Wyrdcasters Novel" style="width:400px; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:10px;">
    <h2>Foreword</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:
200%'>The novel you are about to read opens an epic not just of the Norse gods
and their universe, but of the human spirit, the mystery of life, of
consciousness, and the nature of reality itself. Some people may wonder at how
a lowly lawyer from Sydney, having had no training (or interest) in Norse
history, in mythology, or in creative writing, came up with such a
fantastically imaginative story. I confess, from the outset, that I have had
little to do with its construction. Yes, I have converted the tale into the
form of a modern fantasy novel, but to say that involved any creativity on my
part would be generous. Though there is some overlap with Norse mythology, let
there be no doubt that it was in fact the manuscripts of my great grandfather,
Lennart Erlander, that provided me with this story in its entirety.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:200%'>My great
grandfather Lennart was a strange man. Shunned in his youth for being a mad
eccentric — what would certainly nowadays be classified as a schizophrenic with
delusions of grandeur — having poured over his &quot;ramblings&quot; I am now
convinced there was more at play in Mad Lenn's troubled mind than lunacy. The
parallels between Lennart's writings and the ancient Norse texts could be
easily disregarded as plagiarism or inspiration. However, it is <i>how </i>they
overlap that causes me the most pause: the subtle understandings, the intimate
details, the &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; that completely, and ingeniously,
reinterpret the authentic historical texts. Even more disquieting are the
differences, which seem to borrow from other sources of mythology that were not
known to my great grandfather, who seemed to possess a knowledge of esoteric
mechanics beyond the greatest guru of the Mahabharata, and whose then-laughable
predictions on developments in technology have proven uncanny, rivalling
Asimov's, rivalling Verne's. There is no doubt in my mind that these are the
works of a mad genius, of an Einstein, or an Oppenheimer, someone cursed with
unhinged insight, capable of peering into that which would render the rest of
us <i>mentis morbus</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:200%'>I have endeavoured
to be as invisible as possible in my interpretation, striving to realise
Lennart's vision for what it was. Something of a family embarrassment, his
preserved tomes are dusted off from time to time at the behest of some
historian or other who has stumbled upon their existence from a footnote of a
more established figure of history. Never having had much interest in history,
our family's or otherwise, I find it odd that in the end I was to be the one to
modernise the material after so many a hungry author was denied the right by my
great grandfather's estate. I have done this out of a deep respect for the man
seldom afforded to him by others in my family, with full acknowledgement that I
too, before I knew better, joined in the jokes at his expense around many
family dinners and functions. Considering myself the foremost expert in his
body of work, after the uncomfortable experience of realising this early part
of it, I am floored by the unpolished masterpiece that was his “Novegard”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:200%'>And so, I dedicate
this book to Lennart. If this book accomplishes anything, it is my hope that it
in some part legitimises the inner quest of my ancestor, who toiled in the
darkness so that we may see the light.</span></p>

    <h2>Prologue I: The Watchtower of Æsgarth</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:200%'>The majestic spire that was the Æsgarthian Watchtower loomed over all of reality. Within its heart,
footsteps echoed in the marble stairwell as the determined son of the absentee
king ascended to its peak, to the viewing room that had become his second home
of transcendence and strife. To look out on the mystical twilight from there
was sobering, and yet, of late, the mere sight of the highest of the realms,
the perfected civilisation painted in ethereal hues of white and grey, had
brought only a sense of dread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The panoramic
vista flooded his mind as he entered the circular room without exterior walls,
the apex of the Watchtower suspended above him by forces unknown. The dazzling
view evoked a sense of superiority, of elite power, as if alone, this lofty
watcher of </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Æsgarth, stood at
the top of the universe itself peering out onto all its wonder. The prince
winced at the hubris, and proceeded to the centre. The serene energy that
permeated the room brought a dizzying nausea that only worsened as the robed
figure approached the dais at the heart of the boundary-less chamber. As he
approached, the room expanded out infinitely in all directions, defying
conventional laws of science, and stretching his mind along with it. Reality
bent and warped around him, opening up to him, and flooding his senses
relentlessly. The fair prince grimaced in agony, clutching his temples as he
willed himself through the final steps against the forces of nature, at last
collapsing onto the rune-inscribed iron dais and catching his silent breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>As always, the
short trek had altered him. His transformed mind, less a man's though not quite
a beast's, adopted a silvery keenness and a cosmic, ancient, almost tribal
otherworldliness. Disgusted at himself, he adopted his new mental form, pushing
through the resistance as he rose to behold the dais, that multidimensional
dais of the Aesir, that whispered its harsh secrets to only a cursed few.
Already he could feel the thrumming currents of time beating through him,
drawing him into history itself. He remembered the name Baldur, his own name,
though it was by now foreign to him; and the name Odin, that enigma of a name
that defied even itself. He feared how far would he go to learn its secrets.
Yet it was his yearning hope, that longing for answers, perhaps even the simple
want of a child to be reunited with his father, that remained familiar. That
spurred him on as the young god wrestled against the merciless quantum stream,
forcing it to his ends. At the zenith of the mental maelstrom, struggling to hold
on to his fleeting purpose and already losing his grip on his multitudinous
senses, Baldur dove into the eternal waves of time and was lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>#<a
name=Part2></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The metallic door
to the dimly lit, hard-copy archive burst open and Trygard stumbled in, blind
drunk, bringing with him the celebratory atmosphere Svolnir had been avoiding
since the ceremony's conclusion. Svolnir had hoped to wait out the historic
night in merciful solitude, hidden from conversations he feared would be his
undoing. But the mead and the silence had done little to keep the mental
chatter at bay, and with the arrival of his fun-loving partner his fate was all
but sealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Svoly, you
promised!&quot; Trygard spattered pulling up a nearby seat and collapsing into
it, catching his balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Did I?&quot;
Svolnir responded coldly. &quot;Then I am a breaker of promises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Svolnir reached
for his drink but Trygard slapped it away before he could take the bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You've
either had too much, or not nearly enough!&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Trygard took a
swig himself then gave his neurotic Wyrdling partner a sympathetic look through
pup’s eyes, his stubble, and loosened shirt and coat, granting him the aura of
a quintessential off-the-clock associate primed to seize the town at weeks end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Go back to
the party, Trygard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't
think I will, Master 'Saviour of Heim',&quot; he said as he looked down at the
mead bottle in his hand. It was the one they had promised to open when this was
all done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, shit
on me,&quot; said Trygard, setting down the bottle gently and staring off
through the door, his mind drifting, the faint music and the sounds of the
crowd wafting in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;This is
about the residue, isn't it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Svolnir said
nothing, a defiant look on his face. Trygard stood, his mood soured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You just
can't let it go. We ran every test, it is well with acceptable
parameters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Parameters
for economic loss!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Trygard shook his
head disapprovingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;After
everything, you can't just be happy, for once, and take the win. Typical Svoly,
always needing a problem to solve. We have done the impossible! We have grasped
it from the ether and made it ours! Would you please just take a moment to
think of what we have accomplished!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Svolnir slouched,
on the edge of tears, his friend's words of encouragement the defeating blow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;That is all
I can think of, Trygard,&quot; said Svolnir, his Wyrd screaming, and his heart
no longer able to outrun the truth of their crime. &quot;And the thoughts
ravage my spirit with the promise of what our accomplishment shall accomplish
in our name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>#</span><a name=Part3></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Baldur tore his
mind away from the erroneous vision and his consciousness returned to the
rarefied plane of </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Æsgarth, and
the Watchtower. Ignoring the sublime beauty of his surroundings, the ardent
prince took a focused breath and steeled himself, detaching from the drama and
refocusing on the goal: Odin. Like plunging back into deep, ice-cold waters,
Baldur re-engaged the dais and descended into the past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>#</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The parapet
trembled from the heavy fire from the Aesirian army at their gates, and Ullric
Frostbane, the White, revelled in psychotic abandon at the destruction that
would be his undoing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My Lord, we
must flee at once!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>An imposing device
resembling a technologically-advanced trebuchet had begun to power up,
thrumming with blue light, as the frenetic enemy pressed on in their assault
against the fortress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh, how they
fear he who rivals their own facsimiles,&quot; he said, the light of the
machine and the weapons' fire reflecting in his own glowing eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My
Lord!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Bring me the
device from the vault,&quot; Ullric ordered, the commander's pleas unheeded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Lord Ullric,
the Drakyonstone has vanished. There is nought left but to retreat into hiding
in the mountains. Already the men have departed, we must not delay!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>With fury
unmatched by mortal men, Ullric turned his shining gaze upon the
heavily-armoured and battleworn officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Vanished?!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In an instant,
Ullric was dangling the terrified commander over the edge with one outstretched
arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The Oracle,
my Lord! She is unable to be found!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Ullric squeezed,
interrogating the man with a look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;After...
ugh... investigations, I suspect thy lady has anticipated this attack and...
and that the stone is safe in her keeping...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Having heard
enough, Ullric let go of the commander; as he plummeted screaming to his demise
to be consumed by the foray, Ullric the White seemed to vanish. A moment after
the shrieking came to an abrupt end, Ullric returned, covered in blood,
shortsword soaked and dripping. Taking one last look at the Aesirian forces,
their mighty weapon firing its first thunderous shots, making short work of the
outer defences, Ullric dropped his blade in defeat and returned to within the
stronghold. As he descended the bloody stone steps, over corpses he had left
behind, he pondered bitterly how close he had come to victory. The fortress
shook from the impact of the machine and the ceiling began to crumble. With a
slow and measured gate, mind swimming from exhausting his powers, he made his
way through the tomb-like halls and into the graveyard that was once the
fortress's gardens. The road to the mountains from the rear, too, was littered
with bodies. There were none he had left alive. To his dismay, the body of
Ullric's wife was not among them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>#</span><a name=Part4></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Baldur pulled
back, discouraged by the thought of yet another day of failure, and unable to
continue his attempt at forcing the Watchtower into his favoured direction. The
day-star had risen, but it was far too soon for the compressive throbbing in
his head, yet far too late in the hour of man to abandon the day's efforts. The
weariness of his quest weighed upon him, the frustration and the feeling of
being imprisoned by fate. Why was the tower resisting his desire to learn the
truth, he wondered, annoyed at this final deadlock after much deliberation and
sacrifice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Baldur turned his
attention to his ring, Draupnir, the heavy gold ring which had belonged to his
father and now adorned his mid-finger. The perplexing band reflected the
circular room strangely, and, as always, its eight mirages fanned out around
his hand confounding the gaze. After Baldur had discovered its whereabouts in
the bowels of Muspelheim, and toiled to retrieved it, he was sure that he had
obtained the final piece to the puzzle; that the answers would be forthcoming.
How absurd the thought seemed to him now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>A flash, a mere
flash. A figure -- could it have been Odin? -- removing the ring and placing it
within the dais, at a protrusion imperceptible to the eye. Baldur fumbled at
the fleeting image, that vanished as quickly as it had appeared, as if his
reaching for it pushed it further away! Galvanised by some progress at last,
Baldur mimicked the shadowy figure, removing the ring and placing it upon the
dais, feeling for the protrusion he could not see. Locked, the dais shifted
from within, the sound of stone grinding against stone as the ring was pulled
into it, and the runes lit up magnificently. The natural forces remained, but
stabilised somehow, bringing a feeling of separation from the Watchtower that
simultaneously reversed some of its more imposing effects. With the ring
serving as a lightning rod for the wayward visions of the enigmatic tower, the
currents of time seemed to part. The path had become clearer than ever, and,
emboldened, Baldur surged with duty and purpose. Once more, his father's pitiless
face fixed in his mind, the son of Odin descended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>#</span><a name=Part5></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The wind howled
through the Iron Wood in the dead of night as Jofrid froze on the steps of the
secluded cabin. The areas south of Riverfall by the Outlands were rumoured to
be teeming with Frostspawn, but tonight it was the cold that Jofrid feared
above all else, and it was only the thought of his ailing wife that kept his
feet planted. The decrepit front door opened and the crone smiled her ghastly
smile, less in greeting and more out of sadism, but she bowed and stood aside
allowing her desperate visitor entry. Jofrid shuffled inside the warm,
oddly-smelling cabin, removing his snow-heavy coat and boots, albeit with some
difficulty as his fingers were as numb as his feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You have
done well to find me, Aesirim. These woods have stifled the ambitions of many a
needy man,&quot; she sneered, looking Jofrid over with approval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The
directions... were quite clear...&quot; said Jofrid, still shivering from the
weather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Warm
yourself,&quot; she barked, gesturing to the fire, and making her way to the
kitchen and the kettle. &quot;When you are able, we shall discuss the matter of
your visit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;I am...
able... now,&quot; said Jofrid, convincing nobody. The witch simply ignored him
and prepared tea for one as Jofrid did as instructed. By the time she handed
the mug to him, feeling had returned to his extremities and with it a sensation
of quiet exhaustion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You are
terrified,&quot; she said savouring the emotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said Jofrid, his mind hard and focused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;But not of
me,&quot; she said, somewhat disappointed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;It is my
wife.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The witch pulled
away and eyed the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Pregnant,&quot;
she said nodding with understanding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid's
suspicions eased somewhat; if she was a charlatan, she had researched well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;It has
been... irregular,&quot; said Jofrid, knowing he could not trust to this
stranger yet aware that his options were few and his need great. &quot;She is
in near constant agony. She doesn't sleep. She refuses to eat anything but raw
meat. Her only respite is a trance that seems to offer her sublime relief, but
in that blissful state she is taken to ranting of delusions of an utterly
terrifying nature. I fear she has become possessed by some foul being, though
even to utter these words is a stab in my heart at how I betray her and my
unborn son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You are a
man of fine clothes and a finer tongue, Assemblyman. And I dare say a fine
mind. Your wife's case would be clear to all as a most present danger. Yet you
have come to Ironwood, at the Empire's edge, the <i>world's</i> edge, and not
Stormhold, that fine city with its Dvergar and Pionics. Have you so little
faith in the mechanical wonders of your <i>fine</i> people?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>There was a
mocking undertone to the witches’ words, as if she savoured the opportunity to
see an Aesirian crawl to her in an hour of need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The Aesirian
people have a generation hence outlawed the use of Dvergar and Pionics. The
frost has become... increasingly hostile to any technology of that nature. The
risks in even the most limited of use are now too great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, a
pity,&quot; she snarled, though how any could not have been aware of the fact
after nearly three decades was beyond Jofrid's guess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My father
has in his employment a private physician, she is trustworthy, and yet...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid felt a lump
in his throat, not quite sure how to continue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;We have
reason to believe the issue is of an... otherworldly nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You know
full well that it is!&quot; she hissed, the facade of her politeness dropping
to reveal the bile. &quot;Do not think because I have accepted your coin that I
must suffer your deceptions and your meandering!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The fireplace
flicked green for a moment and returned to normal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Out with
it!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid forced out
the words that seemed to be blocked in his mind by a mighty shield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Wyrdcaster.
The child she carries, there can no longer be any doubt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Is he?&quot;
said the witch, once again savouring the moment. &quot;And you know this
how?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;There have
been many omens too direct to ignore. Yet ignore them I did, for as long as I
could. Then came the visions and the terrible sickness. I thought my wife was
going mad. I hoped... But the pregnancy has held for much too long. Fourteen
months and no sign of an end. And the things my wife is able to do...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid stared out
at the cascade of impossible memories of his wife that had plagued his mind
ever since.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The
pregnancy has eaten her through -- life has all but fled from her! She is less
than a husk of herself, hanging by a silk thread. Each night could be her last,
and I fear I will return home to a corpse! Our physician is certain she will
not survive delivery; she has begged us to terminate for the sake of the
mother... Please, if you have any means of saving them both, I would be in your
debt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My debt, you
say?&quot; mused the witch, finally hearing the terms she was waiting to hear,
and turning away as if to conceal her salivation at the prospect; and the
piping tea within Jofrid's palms seemed to grow suddenly cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>#</span><a name=Part6></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The Colonel
will see you now, Assemblyman Stormr.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid rose from
his heated leather seat in the antechamber and smiled politely at the
receptionist, the view of the weathered city of Stormhold behind her
spectacular and clearly meant to impress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Colonel,&quot;
Jofrid said, extending his arm as the Colonel rose to greet him. &quot;My
thanks for your time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Come now,
Jofrid,&quot; said the Colonel jovially, grasping the man's wrist in
friendship. &quot;Let us set aside the weight of rank and station momentarily.
How often these days does one get the opportunity to reconnect with old
friends?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:200%'>&quot;These days,
Morgrim?&quot; said Jofrid wearily. &quot;Not often enough,&quot; agreeing to
the implied terms of the meeting the Colonel had set as he vocalised his
agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;How about a
drink? No doubt your tastes have matured since those days at college, but day
the word and I'll have a cask of the old swill brought up!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Apologies,
old friend,&quot; said Jofrid declining the offer. &quot;The day will come when
we can raise our horns high in celebration, but I fear today we must turn our
tongues with haste to darker, more immediate matters ill fit for toasts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Let us
hasten the day's arrival,&quot; the Colonel said soberly, and he gestured for
Jofrid to sit opposite his grandiose, presidential desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My wife has
borne a child, Morgrim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Colonel Morgrim
leaned back into his throne like chair, his face darkening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Another
man's?&quot; he asked bluntly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;No! No,
nothing like that,&quot; said Jofrid, frightened at the thought of what his
&quot;old friend&quot; would do with such information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;And yet your
face is long and weathered with stress, when you should be leaping for the
mead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The child
is... unwell,&quot; said Jofrid, evading the issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;I am sorry
to hear it, Jofrid,&quot; said Morgrim sympathetically. &quot;Tell me of the
child's illness, perhaps together, with our joint resources, we can find a
treatment for the Stormrchild.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid sighed a
jagged sigh, realising his next words could either doom is newborn son, or save
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My son is a
Wyrdcaster,&quot; he said, dropping the truth of it like an explosive into the
heart of the battlefield. To his credit, Colonel Morgrim did not flinch, he did
not reach for the intercom and summon the guards, nor did he look on in fear
and judgement. The Colonel simply rose from his seat, walked to his liquor
cabinet, and withdrew a bottle from the top shelf, as well as a pair of crystal
horns. Returning, he poured two drinks, sliding one over to his tortured old
friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;The Agency
is at our doorstep,&quot; Jofrid blurted in panic. &quot;The initial tests have
already been completed, there was nothing we could have done without raising
suspicion! They'll come for him, Morgrim. They may already be coming for him as
we speak!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Morgrim tapped the
rim of the crystal horn with a finger, his look stern and demanding. Compliant,
Jofrid downed the exquisite, syrupy mead, which burned his chest and throat but
settled his nerves, and went silent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;We were
inoculated against the Wyrdcaster gene, General,&quot; said Jofrid. &quot;We
have no idea how the mutation took hold. The conception, the birth, it was all
perfectly... uneventful. Until... it wasn't.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Morgrim sat in contemplation for a time,
looking on at a simulacrum of the planet of Heim on his desk by the ceremonial
sword at its front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Retrieval of
the tests is the first priority,&quot; said Morgrim, detailing the plan of
attack. &quot;It is hardly surprising they have not come for your son; after
repeated budget cuts following the frost incursion closing the Vanirian Gap
their backlog is notoriously long. His records will need to be doctored, and
safeguards put in place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Of
course,&quot; said Jofrid with the deepest gratitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;How is
Eidvaka?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;Her mind </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>has recovered, though she is still far too
frail...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;I shall see
to her treatment, but there is to be no other medical intervention. It all goes
through private channels, whether it’s a scrape of the arm or
disembowelment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Jofrid's mind
turned to the non-medical intervention provided by the potions of the Ironwood
witch, but said nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;My thanks,
Morgrim,&quot; said Jofrid, his thoughts turning to the cost of this
generosity. &quot;How can we ever repay</span><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'> you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Morgrim poured
another drink for Jofrid, his own drink still sitting idle on the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>&quot;You are to
resign from the Assembly,&quot; Morgrim said, his words equal parts command and
threat. &quot;Find a place away from civilisation, yet still within the borders
of the Empire, take your wife and your son, steering well clear of your father
and his treachery, and enter an early retirement of <i>absolute</i>
seclusion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The request
baffled Jofrid, for the resignation would nullify any political influence
Morgrim had over the Assemblyman. Yet knowing the man as he did, the twisted,
brilliant machinations of his politically ruthless mind, Jofrid stiffened at
the thought of how the manoeuvre fit into the delicate balance of the Colonel's
greater plan. As if sensing the man's hesitation, Morgrim lifted his crystal
horn an inch from the desk, staring Jofrid dispassionately in the eye as he
awaited a response. Cornered by fate, and consumed by the weight of his own
failure, Jofrid raised his horn in sombre agreement. For he knew had traded
death and annihilation for twin debts of unknown quantities, and -- in an
effort to salvage his sense of worth -- his mind turned to that impending
exile, where he vowed he would with singular focus defend his family from the
fallout of a father's poor choices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Baldur inched back
from the unfolding Stormr family history pouring into his mind. With increasing
confidence, spurred by his partial success at compelling the mechanism to his
father's first days, and hoping at last to locate the man himself, Baldur willed
the temporal adjustment, his father's juvenile years passing by like falling
rain till the rain could be compelled to fall no more.</span></p>
