  <div class="section-title">What is Wyrdcasters?</div>
  <img src="your-mythic-action-image.jpg" alt="Mythic action scene" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:10px;">
  <p>In the tradition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Dune</em>, and the <em>Cthulhu Mythos</em>, <strong>Wyrdcasters</strong> is a fantasy universe developed through literature, music, mythology, film, and scholarly research, inspired by Norse and Indo-European mythology.</p>

<p>The Wyrdcasters saga is the central mythopoeic work of the Wyrdcasters universe — an epic unfolding across nine volumes, beginning with the opening trilogy. Inspired by Norse mythology and shaped through visions experienced during a profound break from ordinary reality, the Wyrdcasters saga forms the spine of a larger creative mythos. After half a decade devoted to building the cosmology, histories, and laws of its world, Robert stepped away from a life in corporate law to give full voice to the mythic vision revealed to him. At its core, the saga asks a singular question — a question the author anticipates may take a lifetime, or longer, to answer:</p>

<p><em>What if the Norse gods were real — evolved and advanced beings from a bygone age — but the stories we inherited were distorted by the limited understanding of ancient minds?</em></p>

    <h3><em>Wyrdcasters: Book I – Reckoning</em></h3>
    <p>The first novel in the Wyrdcasters saga, releasing late 2025.</p>
    <img src="your-novel-cover.jpg" alt="Wyrdcasters Novel" style="width:400px; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:10px;">
    <p><strong>Discover the secret origins of the Norse gods in <em>Wyrdcasters – Book I: Reckoning</em> — the debut installment in the imaginative sci-fi/fantasy epic.</strong></p>
    <p>The ancient land of Heim stands on the brink of collapse: frost monsters spread like an icy plague across a corrupted, frozen realm; invaders press from without, and traitors plot from within — all while mysterious forces lurking in the shadows attempt to manipulate the fate of the universe. Amidst this turmoil, Odin’s long-dormant powers awaken — and he is cast into exile. To prevent his world from descending into chaos, the young god-to-be and his allies must rally the legends of Norse mythology — the Wyrdcasters — whose combined might just may be enough to halt Heim's descent into madness and ruin.</p>

    <p>The music of Wyrdcasters offers a sonic gateway into the mythic realm of madness, myth, and metaphysics. It extends the mythos into music through an epic journey across cinematic orchestration, dark ambient landscapes, and mythic progressive compositions — <i>sometimes all at once.</i> Each piece is a short story evoking the dark and powerful transcendence at the heart of the Wyrdcasters universe.</p>
    <h3><em>Wyrdcasters: The Death of Odin</em></h3>
    <p><strong>A haunting musical companion to the Wyrdcasters saga.</strong></p>
    <img src="TDOO.jpg" alt="The Death of Odin Poster" style="width:400px; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:10px;">
    <p>A dark modern opera exploring mythic corruption, personal loss, and the collapse of cosmic order. Set in the distant future in the highest realm of Asgard, <em>The Death of Odin</em> follows Lord Baldur and Commander Tyr as they are locked in a psychological game of cat and mouse following the mysterious murder of Baldur’s father, King Odin. As their voices clash and intertwine in grief, corruption, and the desperate search for truth, they are drawn into confrontation with the Dark Prophet: a spectral force who channels the malevolent energy at the heart of the tale.</p>
    <p>Structured like a cross between <em>Les Misérables</em>, Dream Theater's <em>Scenes from a Memory</em>, and Wagner’s <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, <em>The Death of Odin</em> blurs the lines between chamber opera, concept album, and staged concert. With a sweeping score that fuses cinematic progressive rock with the storytelling intensity of a Norse-inspired orchestral score, this one-hour, three-person opera unfolds a distant page within the Wyrdcasters mythos.</p>
